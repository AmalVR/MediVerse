# Unity 3D Viewer Configuration

The Unity 3D Anatomy Viewer is now **optional** and can be easily disabled if you encounter issues with Unity WebGL files.

## Quick Disable

To disable Unity completely, add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_UNITY_ENABLED=false
```

## What Happens When Disabled

When Unity is disabled:
- ✅ The app continues to work normally
- ✅ All other features remain available (videos, AI learning, live sessions)
- ✅ A friendly placeholder is shown instead of Unity errors
- ✅ No more "corrupt file" or "compression" errors

## Error Messages You'll See Instead

Instead of technical Unity errors, users will see:
- "3D Anatomy Viewer is currently unavailable"
- "You can still explore anatomy content through videos and interactive learning"
- "This feature is optional - you can continue using all other learning features"

## Benefits

1. **No More Blocking Errors**: Unity issues won't prevent users from using the app
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear, friendly messages instead of technical errors
3. **Easy Toggle**: Simple environment variable to enable/disable
4. **Graceful Degradation**: App works perfectly without Unity

## Re-enabling Unity

To re-enable Unity later, simply remove the `VITE_UNITY_ENABLED=false` line from your `.env` file or set it to `true`:

```bash
VITE_UNITY_ENABLED=true
```

## Development Notes

- Unity files are checked on startup
- If files are missing or corrupt, the app automatically switches to fallback mode
- Users can retry Unity loading (up to 2 attempts)
- After max retries, Unity is marked as optional
- All Unity-related errors are caught and handled gracefully

This makes the app much more robust and user-friendly!
